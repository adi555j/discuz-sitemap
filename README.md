# discuz-sitemap <br />
this is a basic xml sitemap generator for disquz!. I have tested it in early 2015. <br />

It can now generate xml file sitemap.xml . <br />
**upload it to your base directory <br />
**run it once , if a older sitemap will be present it will be deleted and you will be informed about its deletion <br />
**run it again and it will create a xml file sitemap.xml in the base directory. <br />
**delete the sitemap.php file. Upload it when you want to create a new sitemap <br />
