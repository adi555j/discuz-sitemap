# discuz-sitemap <br />
this is a basic xml sitemap generator for disquz!. I have tested it in early 2015. 

It can now generate xml file sitemap.xml .
**upload it to your base directory
**run it once , if a older sitemap will be present it will be deleted and you will be informed about its deletion
**run it again and it will create a xml file sitemap.xml in the base directory.
**delete the sitemap.php file. Upload it when you want to create a new sitemap
